## Introduction

This repo contains data structures implemented in the worst programming language in existence.  

QB64 has a lot of limitations and should not be used for anything. In addition to its massive lack of capabilities, it also lacks a lot of fundamental data structures.  

Due to it's severe incompetencies, such as a lack of OOP and the inability of functions to return UDTs, the implementation is insanely tedious, requiring direct memory manipulation, and is also as barebones as it gets, being limited to only storing integers.   

The code is bad because the language is bad.
