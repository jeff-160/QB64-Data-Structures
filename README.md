## Introduction

This repo contains data structures made in the worst programming language in existence.  

QB64 has a lot of limitations and should not be used for anything. In addition to its massive lack of capabilities, it also lacks a lot of fundamental data structures.  

Due to it's severe incompetencies, such as a lack of OOP and the inability of functions to return UDTs, the implementation is insanely tedious, requiring direct memory manipulation. 

The code is bad because the language is bad.
